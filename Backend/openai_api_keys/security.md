# Security Guidelines for OpenAI API Integration

## 🔐 API Key Security

### DO's ✅
- Store API keys in environment variables
- Use different keys for different environments
- Rotate keys regularly (monthly recommended)
- Monitor API usage and set up alerts
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement rate limiting
- Validate all input data
- Log security events

### DON'Ts ❌
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Don't share keys in chat, email, or documentation
- Don't use the same key across multiple projects
- Don't hardcode keys in source code
- Don't expose keys in client-side code
- Don't ignore security warnings

## 🛡️ Implementation Security

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Good: Use environment variables
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_key_here

# Bad: Hardcoded in source
const apiKey = "sk-your_key_here";
```

### Input Validation
```javascript
// Good: Validate input
if (!message || typeof message !== 'string') {
  return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Invalid input' });
}

// Bad: No validation
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: req.body.message }]
});
```

### Rate Limiting
```javascript
// Good: Implement rate limiting
const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100 // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
});
```

## 🚨 Security Monitoring

### API Usage Monitoring
- Set up usage alerts in OpenAI dashboard
- Monitor for unusual patterns
- Track costs and usage spikes
- Log all API calls with timestamps

### Error Handling
- Don't expose internal errors to clients
- Log errors securely
- Implement proper error responses
- Use try-catch blocks for API calls

## 🔒 Production Security Checklist

- [ ] API keys stored in secure environment variables
- [ ] HTTPS enabled for all endpoints
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented
- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] Error handling doesn't expose sensitive data
- [ ] CORS properly configured
- [ ] Security headers implemented (Helmet.js)
- [ ] API usage monitoring set up
- [ ] Regular security audits scheduled
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures in place

## 📊 Security Metrics to Track

- API key usage patterns
- Failed authentication attempts
- Rate limit violations
- Error rates and types
- Response times
- Data processing volumes

## 🆘 Incident Response

### If API Key is Compromised:
1. Immediately revoke the compromised key
2. Generate a new API key
3. Update all environments with new key
4. Monitor for unauthorized usage
5. Review access logs
6. Update security procedures if needed

### If Rate Limits are Exceeded:
1. Check for abuse or bugs
2. Implement stricter rate limiting
3. Add user authentication
4. Monitor usage patterns
5. Consider upgrading OpenAI plan
